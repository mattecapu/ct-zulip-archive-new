In particular, the discrete mode of our theory has semantics in any CwF with pi-types, universes, and ω-limits; any ∞-topos model will satisfy these properties. We accomplish this through a syntactic primitive called <em>display</em>, which is, in semantics, the fibrant counterpart of décalage on augmented semi-simplicial diagrams.</p>\n<p>I am opening this thread to start a discussion on our results! <span aria-label=\"smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f642\" role=\"img\" title=\"smile\">:smile:</span></p>",
